

charger efficiency for network demand?


do it per trip
battery level trigger (below this, will charge)

then max power or spread

How to deal with shift to next day? 
Trip of prior day might correlate with next day
    

bank holidays
holiday trips per year?





in requirements.txt
tomli >= 1.1.0 ; python_version < "3.11" 

ESDL compatibility (+ESSIM?)
Chapter on working as a provider/with other models (optimisers, e.g.)
Collection/combination of reference profiles: Can optimiser help choose split?
Jpurnal of software engineering or other?


Advanced CODEC/socio (combine with optimising work?)
Mopo color palette?
Use logos (ChaProEV and Mopo in readme)


Run weather factors in DB (and pickle?)

SOLAR EFFICIENCY !

            print('Do solar panel efficiency')

            print('Avoid swap by arranging before?')
            print('And explain/improve in all hourly')

            print('Test leg.electricity_use_kWh')
            print('Implement road and hour in day factors')
            print('Go through class definitions (espcially Trip')
            print('Day start hour in one place?')
            print('Fast/station charging')
            print('Add time fator to location charging price?')
            print('Connectivity can vary with time? (e.g. due to higher occupancy')

            PV library Sandia (PV-lib)

Charging point efficiency factor per location and impact on from_grib_to_dataframe

Shading + 890 kWh/kWp in Nll rule of thumb+ Temp (ambient+20)-25 --> 0.5% drop per unit_conversions
Soalr moves: rondomize/spread journeys and such

Where to write computed trip properties (at least non-charge ones, such as location, but maybe also these too)
In scenario_trips, or elsewhere?

Describe connection to optimisation model
Share cookbooj=k with ETS team (focus on some functions, such as SQL query writer)
electricity price: Add (option) for a time correction factor (equal to 1 if not given?)

Density/distribution of building types (houses, work, malls, etc) per zone (e.g.NUTS3)

ESDL in Mopo?

Monte-Carlo/ randomize input (scenarios)
PV from DTU (and other data, see Matti's presentation)

Reference values DB for people to use in other models (SpineOpt, etc): Maybe add reading functions (or structure, matchin SPINE)
Charging costs in aggregates
Have pricing/desirability scaling/flexibility (e.g. charge if need/price reaches a theshold, or use a function, may add desirability to it)

Map plot of kilometrage, charging costs, etc. per country?

Couple to CODEC?


Report to Mikael (and/or run results?) for his student
