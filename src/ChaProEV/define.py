This module defines and declares classes for the different objects
that define the system (the parameters/defintions come from a parameters file),
namely:
1. **Legs:** Legs are point-to-point vehicle movements (i.e. movements where
    the vehicle goes from a start location and ends/stops at an end location).
2. **Vehicles:** Each vehicle type (or subtype) is defined in this class.
3. **Location:** This class defines the locations where the vehicles are
(available charger power, connectivity, latitude, longitude, etc.).
4. **Trips:** Trips are collections of legs that take place on a given day.
    Note that this day does not necessarily start (and end) at minight,
    but can start (and end) at an hour that is more logical/significant for the
    vehicle user (it could for example be 06:00 for car drivers).

This module also includes two functions to declare a chosen class, and
to run that function for all class types.
