Module for comp[uting fuels consumption (e.g. H2, but also fossil/bio, etc.)
Uses travel info from the main computations, an efficiency conversion
to get the consumption of the fuel.
Need to define periods at which the fuel is supplied to stations
(default= one week?). These will be the resolution of the fuel model
