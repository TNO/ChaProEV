This module computes the various functions related to mobility.
It contains the following functions:
1. **get_trip_probabilities_per_day_type:** This function computes the trip
probabilities per day type.
2. **get_run_trip_probabilities:** Gets a DataFrame containing the trip
probabilities for the whole run.
