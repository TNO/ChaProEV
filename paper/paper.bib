abstract = {Urban areas are becoming increasingly crowded, and as a result it is challenging to ensure that these areas remain liveable and accessible. Municipalities need to make strategic long-term decisions regarding urban planning, which is often a difficult and time-consuming task. Digital twins of cities can assist policy makers during this process, providing an integral view on e.g. traffic intensities, air quality and noise. Furthermore, a digital twin enables policy makers to simulate ‘what if scenarios’ in a scenario-based analysis. Digital twins connect data, analytics and visualizations, which requires a system which integrates all these aspects in a single framework. This paper presents the Inter Model Broker framework, which is a scalable framework based on which large-scale digital twins can be built. A key property of our framework is that all connected system modules hold the relevant data locally in memory, which means that no central database is required. The effectiveness of our framework is demonstrated in a case study based on the city of Amsterdam in The Netherlands.}

abstract = {Policy makers across Europe have implemented renewable support policies with several policy objectives in mind. Among these are achieving ambitious renewable energy targets at the lowest cost, reducing CO2-emissions and promoting technology improvement through learning-by-doing. Using a detailed country-level model of generation markets, we address the question of how policies that subsidize renewable energy (feed-in premia and renewable portfolio standards (RPSs)) versus capacity (investment subsidies) impact the mix of renewable investments, electricity costs, renewable share, the amount of subsidies, and consumer prices in the EU electric power market in 2030 and how they interact with other policies such as the EU ETS. Our analysis shows that subsidies of energy output are cost-effective for achieving renewable energy targets in the short run, whereas policies tied to capacity installation yield more investment and might be more effective in reducing technology costs in the longer term. The difference in costs between these two policy options diminish with higher CO2-prices. Although the differences are significant, they are smaller than cost impacts of other renewable policy design features, namely the effect of not allowing EU members to meet their individual targets by trading renewable credits with other member states.}

abstract = {The transition towards more sustainable energy systems poses new requirements on energy system models. New challenges include representing more uncertainties, including short-term detail in long-term planning models, allowing for more integration across energy sectors, and dealing with increased model complexities. SpineOpt is a flexible, open-source, energy system modelling framework for performing operational and planning studies, consisting of a wide spectrum of novel tools and functionalities. The most salient features of SpineOpt include a generic data structure, flexible temporal and spatial structures, a comprehensive representation of uncertainties, and model decomposition capabilities to reduce the computational complexity. These enable the implementation of highly diverse case studies. SpineOpt’s features are presented through several publicly-available applications. An illustrative case study presents the impact of different temporal resolutions and stochastic structures in a co-optimised electricity and gas network. Using a lower temporal resolution in different parts of the model leads to a lower computational time (44%–98% reductions), while the total system cost varies only slightly (-1.22–1.39%). This implies that modellers experiencing computational issues should choose a high level of temporal accuracy only when needed.}

abstract = {Future power systems, in which generation will come almost entirely from variable Renewable Energy Sources (vRES), will be characterized by weather-driven supply and flexible demand. In a simulation of the future Dutch power system, we analyze whether there are sufficient incentives for market-driven investors to provide a sufficient level of security of supply, considering the profit-seeking and myopic behavior of investors. We co-simulate two agent-based models (ABM), one for generation expansion and one for the operational time scale. The results suggest that in a system with a high share of vRES and flexibility, prices will be set predominantly by the demand’s willingness to pay, particularly by the opportunity cost of flexible hydrogen electrolyzers. The demand for electric heating could double the price of electricity in winter, compared to summer, and in years with low vRES could cause shortages. Simulations with stochastic weather profiles increase the year-to-year variability of cost recovery by more than threefold and the year-to-year price variability by more than tenfold compared to a scenario with no weather uncertainty. Dispatchable technologies have the most volatile annual returns due to high scarcity rents during years of low vRES production and diminished returns during years with high vRES production. We conclude that in a highly renewable EOM, investors would not have sufficient incentives to ensure the reliability of the system. If they invested in such a way to ensure that demand could be met in a year with the lowest vRES yield, they would not recover their fixed costs in the majority of years.}

abstract = {Traditionally, wholesale electricity prices were driven by fossil power plants' fuel costs. Optimising the dispatch in five scenarios of fully decarbonised, sector-coupled European power systems, we show how future electricity prices continue to be driven by fuel prices. In contrast to today’s market, however, their impact can also result from opportunity costs of cross-sectoral demand side technologies. Particularly, we find that electrolysers become the main price-setting technology in Europe in the presence of a substantial domestic hydrogen demand and abundant low-variable-cost electricity generation. Consequently, future electricity prices highly depend on uncertain political and technological developments. While price-responsive electricity consumers are able to adapt to varying price levels, investors in variable renewables and inflexible electricity consumers are similarly exposed to significant price risks. Therefore, they could mutually benefit from risk-mitigating instruments. In the hydrogen sector, producers and consumers do not share such a common interest. Hydrogen consumers’ final energy consumption costs vary substantially across scenarios and countries, whereas electrolysers recover their costs in a fairly robust manner.}

Since cycle aging of battery cells represents a substantial part of this operating cost, the cost of battery degradation must be factored in these bids. However, existing models of battery degradation either do not fit market clearing software or do not reflect the actual battery aging mechanism. In this paper we model battery cycle aging using a piecewise linear cost function, an approach that provides a close approximation of the cycle aging mechanism of electrochemical batteries and can be incorporated easily into existing market dispatch programs. By defining the marginal aging cost of each battery cycle, we can assess the actual operating profitability of batteries. A case study demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed model in maximizing the operating profit of a battery energy storage system taking part in the ISO New England energy and reserve markets.},

We then present a hierarchical control framework to coordinate their energy consumption. The upper level of the framework optimizes the aggregate power trajectory of the loads via a two-stage stochastic program, which aims to minimize the total energy costs under uncertain real time electricity prices and renewable generation. At the lower level, we design priority-list based scheduling algorithm for each load type to allocate the resulting power trajectory to individual loads. We then present several numerical examples to compare the performance of the framework against three benchmarks including a fully centralized, globally optimal approach. We find that, while the centralized framework is computationally intractable at even modest numbers of loads, the hierarchical framework scales very well to large numbers of loads and results in electricity costs that are comparable to the centralized benchmark.},

We propose a model for economic evaluation and optimization of inter-regional transmission expansion, as well as the optimal response of generators' investments to locational incentives, that accounts for Kirchhoff's laws and three important nonlinearities. The first is consumer response to energy prices, modeled using elastic demand functions. The second is resistance losses. The third is the product of line susceptance and flows in the linearized DC load flow model. We develop a practical method combining Successive Linear Programming with Gauss-Seidel iteration to co-optimize AC and DC transmission and generation capacities in a linearized DC network while considering hundreds of hourly realizations of renewable supply and load. We test our approach for a European electricity market model including 33 countries. The examples indicate that demand response can be a valuable resource that can significantly affect the economics, location, and amounts of transmission and generation investments.

Analysis and quantification of demand response resources providing ancillary services is necessary to understand the resources' economic value and impact on the power system. Methodologies used to study grid integration of variable generation can be adapted to the study of demand response. In the present work, we describe and implement a methodology to construct detailed temporal and spatial representations of demand response resources and to incorporate those resources into power system models.

Many system operators around the world are challenged by the problems associated with integrating these intermittent resources into the grid. As one of the potential solutions, demand response (DR) is expected to play a major role for mitigating integration issues of intermittent renewable energy resources. In this context, this paper proposes a DR program which helps to integrate wind power by reshaping the load of the system. The DR program provides a framework to procure load reduction from DR resources in the wholesale energy market. The participants in the program submit their offer packages to provide load reduction in the day-ahead energy market. A day-ahead network-constrained market clearing formulation is also proposed which considers the load reduction provided by the DR program participants as an energy market commodity. The proposed method, which is in the mixed-integer linear programming format, determines commitment state of generating units, schedules the energy and spinning reserve provided by generating units, and schedules the load reduction provided by the DR program participants. To reveal the features of the proposed method, several numerical studies are conducted on the IEEE-RTS. The results presented indicate that integrating load reduction in the energy market provides a powerful tool to selectively modify the system load to support wind power integration, while making significant economic and technical benefits for the system.},

The formulation draws a clear distinction between power-capacity and ramp-capability reserves to deal with wind production uncertainty. These power and ramp requirements can be obtained from wind forecast information. The model is formulated as a power-based UC, which schedules power-trajectories instead of the traditional energy-blocks and takes into account the inherent startup and shutdown power trajectories of thermal units. These characteristics allow a correct representation of unit{\textquoteright}s ramp schedule which define their ramp availability for reserves. The proposed formulation significantly decreases operation costs compared to traditional deterministic and stochastic UC formulations while simultaneously lowering the computational burden. The operation cost comparison is made through 5-min economic dispatch simulation under hundreds of out-of-sample wind generation scenarios.},

Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology has drawn great interest in the recent years and its success depends on intelligent scheduling of GVs or S3Ps in constrained parking lots. V2G can reduce dependencies on small expensive units in existing power systems, resulting in reduced operation cost and emissions. It can also increase reserve and reliability of existing power systems. Intelligent unit commitment (UC) with V2G for cost and emission optimization in power system is presented in this paper. As number of gridable vehicles in V2G is much higher than small units of existing systems, UC with V2G is more complex than basic UC for only thermal units. Particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed to balance between cost and emission reductions for UC with V2G. PSO can reliably and accurately solve this complex constrained optimization problem easily and quickly. In the proposed solution model, binary PSO optimizes on/off states of power generating units easily. Vehicles are presented by integer numbers instead of zeros and ones to reduce the dimension of the problem. Balanced hybrid PSO optimizes the number of gridable vehicles of V2G in the constrained parking lots. Balanced PSO provides a balance between local and global searching abilities, and finds a balance in reducing both operation cost and emission. Results show a considerable amount of cost and emission reduction with intelligent UC with V2G. Finally, the practicality of UC with V2G is discussed for real-world applications.},

However, demand response has not been included in standard models for defining the optimal generation technology mix. Three different methodologies are proposed to integrate short-term responsiveness into a generation technology mix optimization model considering operational constraints. Elasticities are included to adjust the demand profile in response to price changes, including cross-price elasticities that account for load shifts among hours. As energy efficiency programs also influence the load profile, interactions of efficiency investments and demand response are also modeled. Comparison of model results for a single year optimization with and without demand response shows peak reduction and valley filling effects, impacting the optimal amounts and mix of generation capacity. Increasing demand elasticity also increases the installed amount of wind capacity, suggesting that demand response yields environmental benefits by facilitating integration of renewable energy.},

Direction must usually be compensated later by a modulation of the same magnitude in the opposite direction. Our analysis takes into account the gaming possibilities of producers and retailers, controlling load flexibility, in the day-ahead energy and reserve I markets, and in imbalance settlement. This analysis is carried out by an agent-based approach where, for every round, each actor uses linear programs to maximize its profit according to forecasts of the prices. The procurement of a reserve is assumed to be determined, for each period, as a fixed percentage of the total consumption cleared in the energy market for the same period. The results show that the provision of reserves by flexible loads has a negligible impact on the energy market prices but, markedly decreases the cost of reserve procurement. However, as the rate of flexible loads increases, the system operator has to rely more and more on non-contracted reserves, which may cancel out the benefits made in the procurement of reserves.},

	abstract = {Advances in IT, control and forecasting capabilities have made demand response a viable, and potentially attractive, option to increase power system flexibility. This paper presents a critical review of the literature in the field of demand response, providing an overview of the benefits and challenges of demand response. These benefits include the ability to balance fluctuations in renewable generation and consequently facilitate higher penetrations of renewable resources on the power system, an increase in economic efficiency through the implementation of real-time pricing, and a reduction in generation capacity requirements. Nevertheless, demand response is not without its challenges. The key challenges for demand response centre around establishing reliable control strategies and market frameworks so that the demand response resource can be used optimally. One of the greatest challenges for demand response is the lack of experience, and the consequent need to employ extensive assumptions when modelling and evaluating this resource. This paper concludes with an examination of these assumptions, which range from assuming a fixed linear price{\textendash}demand relationship for price responsive demand, to modelling the highly diverse, distributed and uncertain demand response resource as a single, centralised negative generator, adopting fixed characteristics and constraints.},

One possible way of reducing these redispatch costs is to introduce demand response in the form of real-time pricing (RTP), which could allow electricity demand to respond to actual real-time wind resource availability using price signals. A day-ahead unit commitment model with day-ahead wind forecasts and a real-time dispatch model with actual wind resource availability is used to estimate system operations in a high wind penetration scenario. System operations are compared to a perfect foresight benchmark, in which actual wind resource availability is known day-ahead. The results show that wind integration costs with fixed demands can be high, both due to real-time redispatch costs and lost load. It is demonstrated that introducing RTP can reduce redispatch costs and eliminate loss of load events. Finally, social surplus with wind generation and RTP is compared to a system with neither and the results demonstrate that introducing wind and RTP into a market can result in superadditive surplus gains.},

Based on the results of the panel causality test, there are reciprocal causal relationships among real income, real energy price, and total energy consumption. Furthermore, a uni-directional causality runs from income and electricity price to electricity onsumption. The results for the panel as a whole suggest that the demand for total energy and electricity in the OECD countries is driven largely by strong economic growth, while consumers are largely insensitive to price changes.

The concept goal of the smart grid along with the future deployment of the EVs puts forward various challenges in terms of electric grid infrastructure, communication and control. Following an intensive review on advanced smart metering and communication infrastructures, the strategy for integrating the EVs into the electric grid is presented. Various EV smart charging technologies are also extensively examined with the perspective of their potential, impacts and limitations under the vehicle-to-grid (V2G) phenomenon. Moreover, the high penetration of renewable energy sources (wind and photovoltaic solar) is soaring up into the power system. However, their intermittent power output poses different challenges on the planning, operation and control of the power system networks. On the other hand, the deployment of EVs in the energy market can compensate for the fluctuations of the electric grid. In this context, a literature review on the integration of the renewable energy and the latest feasible solution using EVs with the insight of the promising research gap to be covered up are investigated. Furthermore, the feasibility of the smart V2G system is thoroughly discussed. In this paper, the EVs interactions with the smart grid as the future energy system model are extensively discussed and research gap is revealed for the possible solutions.},

To avoid shifting a large portion of consumer demand toward the least price intervals, which could create network issues due to loss of diversity, higher prices are applied when the consumer's demand goes beyond a prescribed power threshold. The arising mixed integer nonlinear optimization problem is solved in an iterative manner rolling throughout the day to follow the changes in the anticipated price signals and the variations in the controller inputs while information is updated.

	abstract = {The high penetration of both Distributed Energy Resources (DER) and Demand Response (DR) in modern power systems requires a sequence of advanced strategies and technologies for maintaining system reliability and flexibility. Real-time electricity markets (RTM) are the non-discriminatory transaction platforms for providing necessary balancing services, where the market clearing (nodal or zonal prices depending on markets) is very close to real time operations of power systems. One of the primary functions of RTMs in modern power systems is establishing an efficient and effective mechanism for small DER and DR to participate in balancing market transactions, while handling their meteorological or intermittent characteristics, facilitating asset utilization, and stimulating their active responses. Consequently, RTMs are dedicated to maintaining the flexibility and reliability of power systems. This paper reviews advanced typical RTMs respectively in the North America, Australia and Europe, focusing on their market architectures and incentive policies for integrating DER and DR in electricity markets. In this paper, RTMs are classified into three groups: Group I applies nodal prices implemented by optimal power flow, which clears energy prices every 5min. Group II applies zonal prices, with the time resolution of 5-min. Group III is a general balancing market, which clears zonal prices intro-hourly. The various successful advanced RTM experiences have been summarized and discussed, which provides a technical overview of the present RTMs integrating DER and DR.},

	abstract = {Distributed energy resources ({\textquotedblleft}DERs{\textquotedblright}) are being adopted throughout the world. Aggregators are lauded by some as critical in enabling DERs to provide these valuable electricity services at scale; in this light, regulatory and policy bodies are discussing the role of aggregators and even the need to support their market entry. In order to shed light on the economically efficient regulation of aggregators in electricity systems, this paper systematically assesses the economic fundamentals of aggregators. We perform a critical review of the value of aggregators, defining the factors that determine their role in power systems under different technological and regulatory scenarios. We identify three categories of value that aggregators may create: fundamental, transitory, and opportunistic. Fundamental value is intrinsic to aggregation and is independent of the market or regulatory context. Transitory value can be significant in the near term, but may be diminished by technological or regulatory advances. Finally, opportunistic value emerges as a result of regulatory or market design flaws and may endanger the economic efficiency of the power system. This paper provides a template for regulators to encourage the efficient development of aggregators while eliminating the potential for economic inefficiencies through opportunistic aggregation.},

The aggregator aims to maximize its profits from trading energy and regulation reserve in wholesale markets. Since the aggregator does not own EV batteries, the EV owners must be reimbursed for the degradation of their batteries due to the additional cycling beyond transportation needs. This paper proposes a bidding strategy for the aggregator to maximize its profits from participating in competitive energy and different regulating reserves markets, while compensating EV owners for degradation. The results show that depending on the battery cost, the aggregator splits its resources between the energy and reserves markets. The results also show the system operator attains cost savings, if an aggregator uses EVs to provide services.},

	abstract = {An impact of increased variable renewable generation is the need for balancing authorities to procure more ancillary services. While demand response resources are technically capable of providing these services, current experience across the U.S. illustrates they are relatively minor players in most regions. Accessing demand response resources for ancillary services may require a number of changes to policies and common practices at multiple levels. Regional reliability councils must first define ancillary services such that demand response resources may provide them. Once the opportunity exists, balancing authorities define and promulgate rules that set the infrastructure investments and performance attributes of a resource wishing to provide such services. These rules also dictate expected revenue streams which reveal the cost effectiveness of these resources. The regulatory compact between utility and state regulators, along with other statutes and decisions by state policymakers, may impact the interest of demand response program providers to pursue these resources as ancillary service providers. This paper identifies within these broad categories specific market and policy barriers to demand response providing ancillary services in different wholesale and retail environments, with emphasis on smaller customers who must be aggregated through a program provider to meet minimum size requirements for wholesale transactions.},

	abstract = {Growing load factors in winter and summer peaks are a serious problem faced by the Spanish electric energy system. This has led to the extensive use of peak load plants and thus to higher costs for the whole system. Wind energy represents a strongly increasing percentage of overall electricity production, but wind normally does not follow the typical demand profile. As generation flexibility is limited due to technical restrictions, and in absence of large energy storages, the other side of the equilibrium generation-demand has to react. Demand side management measures intend to adapt the demand profile to the situation in the system. In this paper, the operation of an electric system with high wind penetration is modeled by means of a unit commitment problem. Demand shifting and peak shaving are considered in this operation problem. Demand shifting is modeled in two different ways. Firstly, the system operator controls the shift of demand; secondly, each consumer decides its reaction to prices depending on its elasticity. The model is applied to the isolated power system of Gran Canaria. The impact of an increased installed wind capacity on operation and the cost savings resulting from the introduction of responsive demand are assessed. Furthermore, results from the different implemented demand response options are compared.},

The option specifies the range of a potential modification on the demand of the loads within a certain time interval. The specific case where the loads can be modeled by a generic tank model is considered. Under this assumption, the problem of maximizing the range of the load modulation service can be formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem. A novel heuristic-method is proposed to solve this problem in a computationally efficient manner. This method is tested on a set of problems.

	abstract = {Demand response programmes are seen as one of the contributing solutions to the challenges posed to power systems by the large-scale integration of renewable power sources, mostly due to their intermittent and stochastic nature. Among demand response programmes, real-time pricing schemes for small consumers are believed to have significant potential for peak-shaving and load-shifting, thus relieving the power system while reducing costs and risk for energy retailers. This paper proposes a game theoretical model accounting for the Stackelberg relationship between retailers (leaders) and consumers (followers) in a dynamic price environment. Both players in the game solve an economic optimisation problem subject to stochasticity in prices, weather-related variables and must-serve load. The model allows the determination of the dynamic price-signal delivering maximum retailer profit, and the optimal load pattern for consumers under this pricing. The bilevel programme is reformulated as a single-level MILP, which can be solved using commercial off-the-shelf optimisation software. In an illustrative example, we simulate and compare the dynamic pricing scheme with fixed and time-of-use pricing. We find that the dynamic pricing scheme is the most effective in achieving load-shifting, thus reducing retailer costs for energy procurement and regulation in the wholesale market. Additionally, the redistribution of the saved costs between retailers and consumers is investigated, showing that real-time pricing is less convenient than fixed and time-of-use price for consumers. This implies that careful design of the retail market is needed. Finally, we carry out a sensitivity analysis to analyse the effect of different levels of consumer flexibility.},

The relatively low utilisation of generation and networks (of about 50\%) means that there is significant scope for DSM to contribute to increasing the efficiency of the system investment. The importance of the diversity of electricity load is discussed and the negative effects of DSM on load diversity illustrated. Ageing assets, the growth in renewable and other low-carbon generation technologies and advances in information and communication technologies are identified as major additional drivers that could lead to wider applications of DSM in the medium term. Potential benefits of DSM are discussed in the context of generation and of transmission and distribution networks. The provision of back-up capacity by generation may not be efficient as it will be needed relatively infrequently, and DSM may be better placed to support security. We also present an analysis of the value of DSM in balancing generation and demand in a future UK electricity system with significant variable renewable generation. We give a number of reasons for the relatively slow uptake of DSM, particularly in the residential, commercial and small business sectors. They include a lack of metering, information and communication infrastructure, lack of understanding of the benefits of DSM, problems with the competitiveness of DSM when compared with traditional approaches, an increase in the complexity of system operation and inappropriate market incentives.},

The concept of an asymmetric block offer for flexible loads is introduced. This offer structure describes the ability of a flexible load to provide a response to the power system and the subsequent need to recover. The conventional system dispatch algorithm is altered to facilitate the dispatch of demand response units alongside generating units using the proposed offer structure. The value of demand response is assessed through case studies that dispatch flexible supermarket refrigeration loads for the provision of regulating power. The demand resource is described by a set of asymmetric blocks, and a set of four blocks offers is shown to offer cost savings for the procurement of regulating power in excess of 20\%. For comparative purposes, the cost savings achievable with a fully observable and controllable demand response resource are evaluated, using a time series model of the refrigeration loads. The fully modeled resource offers greater savings; however the difference is small and potentially insufficient to justify the investment required to fully model and control individual flexible loads.},

Furthermore, drivers and barriers to the adoption of energy efficiency technologies are considered in this paper revealing the factors affecting the diffusion of energy efficient and waste heat recovery technologies and their interactions and interdependencies to energy consumptions. Findings show that it is possible to achieve energy consumption reduction in excess of 15\% from a technical point of view, however improving energy efficiency in UK industry has been hindered due to some inter-related technical, economic, regulatory and social barriers. The findings help to demonstrate the significant potential for energy efficiency improvement in two industrial sectors, as well as showing the specific types of technologies relevant for different sectoral processes. The range of business models show opportunities for implementation and for developing innovative business models, addressing barriers, and using enablers to accelerate the diffusion of energy efficiency technologies in UK industry.},

In energy systems mainly relying on photovoltaic and wind power, DR may furthermore contribute to system stability and increase the renewable energy share. In this paper, an assessment of the theoretical DR potential in Europe is presented. Special attention is given to temporal availability and geographic distribution of flexible loads. Based on industrial production and electricity consumption statistics, as well as periodic and temperature-dependent load profiles, possible load reduction and increase is estimated for each hour of the year. The analysis identifies substantial DR potentials in all consumer sectors. They add up to a minimum load reduction of 61~GW and a minimum load increase of 68~GW, available in every hour of the year. The overall potential features significant variations during the year, which are characteristic for specific consumers and countries.},

The electrification of the heat sector, except from energy efficiency gains, may offer a vast potential of new forms of flexible demand, by time-shifting of heat production in buildings. The assessment of this potential can, however, be performed only when the limitations imposed by the primary operation of the equipment (space heating) are realistically taken into account. In this paper, a methodology is presented for the quantification of the flexibility offered by the thermal storage of building stock equipped with heat pumps, to power systems with significant penetration of wind power. A model is proposed for the incorporation of the building stock thermal behavior as equivalent energy storage in electricity market models. At the same time, the model allows the coupling to a detailed dynamic thermal model of buildings for the assessment of the respective operational restrictions. The case study presents the results of a project for the evaluation of the flexibility offered by portfolios of high heat pump deployment in conjunction with high wind penetration scenarios for the future German electricity system.},

This paper presents a novel and improved mixed-integer linear problem (MILP) formulation for energy storage of plug-in (hybrid) electric vehicles (PEVs) for reserves in power system models. It is based on insights from the field of System Dynamics, in which complex interactions between different elements are studied by means of feedback loops as well as stocks, flows and co-flows. Generalized to a multi-bus system, this formulation includes improvements in the energy balance and surpasses shortcomings in the way existing literature deals with reserve constraints. Tested on the IEEE 14-bus system with realistic PEV mobility patterns, the deterministic results show changes in the scheduling of the units, often referred to as unit commitment (UC).},

The aim is to minimize charging cost while reducing energy demand from the grid by increasing PV self-consumption and consequently increasing sustainability of the BEV fleet. The developed EMS consists of two components: An autoregressive integrated moving average model to predict PV power production and a mixed-integer linear programming framework that optimally allocates power to minimize charging cost. The results show that the developed EMS is able to reduce charging cost significantly, while increasing PV self-consumption and reducing energy consumption from the grid. Furthermore, during a case study analogous to one repeatedly considered in the literature, i.e., dynamic purchase tariff and dynamic feed-in tariff, the EMS reduces charging cost by 118.44 \$\%\$ and 427.45\$\%\$ in case of one and two charging points, respectively, when compared to an uncontrolled charging policy.},

In both models the charging and discharging of EVs is optimised together with the rest of the power system. Neither the system cost nor the market price of electricity for EVs turned out to be high (36{\textendash}263 {\texteuro}/vehicle/year in the analysed scenarios). Most of the benefits of smart EVs come from smart timing of charging although benefits are also accrued from provision of reserves and lower power plant portfolio cost. The benefits of smart EVs are 227 {\texteuro}/vehicle/year. This amount has to cover all expenses related to enabling smart EVs and need to be divided between different actors.

Equivalent storage capacity is defined as the amount of power and electricity consumption which can be deferred or anticipated in time with respect to the baseline consumption (i.e. when no demand side event occurs) without violating temperature limits. The analysis is carried out for 4 common domestic TCLs: an electric space heating system, freezer, fridge, and electric water heater. They are simulated by applying grey-box thermal models identified from measurements. They describe the heat transfer of the considered TCLs as a function of the electric power consumption and environment conditions. To represent typical TCLs operating conditions, Monte Carlo simulations are developed, where models inputs and parameters are sampled from relevant statistical distributions. The analysis provides a way to compare flexible demand against competitive storage technologies. It is intended as a tool for system planners to assess the TCLs potential to support electrical grid operation. In the paper, a comparison of the storage capacity per unit of capital investment cost is performed considering the selected TCLs and two grid-connected battery storage systems (a 720~kVA/500~kWh lithium-ion unit and 15~kVA/120 kWh Vanadium flow redox) is performed.},

The tighter characteristic reduces the search space and the more compact characteristic increases the searching speed with which solvers explore that reduced space. Therefore, as a natural consequence, the proposed formulation significantly reduces the computational burden in comparison with analogous MILP-based UC formulations. We provide computational results comparing the proposed formulation with two others which have been recognized as computationally efficient in the literature. The experiments were carried out on 40 different power system mixes and sizes, running from 28 to 1870 generating units.},

The focus of this paper is to investigate and quantify the cost impact of various demand response modelings on unit commitment and dispatch in a day-ahead market regime.

Our research results show that DR can exert downward pressure on electricity prices, causing significant implications on social welfare.

However, price responsive load has not been included in standard models for defining the optimal scheduling of generation units in short-term. Here, elasticities are included to adjust the demand profile in response to price changes, including cross-price elasticities that account for load shifts among hours. The resulting peak reductions and valley fill alter the optimal unit commitment. Enhancing demand response also increases the amount of wind power that can be economically injected. Further, wind power uncertainty can be managed at a lower cost by adjusting electricity consumption in case of wind forecast errors, which is another way in which demand response facilitates the integration of intermittent renewables.},

Allowing asymmetric block offers (including response and rebound blocks) in balancing markets can facilitate the participation of flexibility aggregators and unlock load-shifting flexibility from, e.g., thermostatic loads. In this paper, we formulate an optimal offering strategy for a risk-averse flexibility aggregator participating in such a market. Using a price-taker approach, load flexibility characteristics and balancing market price forecast scenarios are used to find optimal load-shifting offers under uncertainty. The problem is formulated as a stochastic mixed-integer linear program and can be solved with reasonable computational time. This work is taking place in the framework of the real-life demonstration project EcoGrid 2.0, which includes the operation of a balancing market on the island of Bornholm, Denmark. In this context, aggregators will participate in the market by applying the offering strategy optimization tool presented in this paper.},

	abstract = {The transition towards energy systems characterized by high share of weather dependent renewable energy sources poses the problem of balancing the mismatch between inflexible production and inelastic demand with appropriate solutions, which should be feasible from the techno-economic as well as from the environmental point of view. Temporal and spatial decoupling of supply and demand is an important element to be considered for the evolution of built environment, especially when creating sectorial level planning strategies and policies. Energy efficiency measures, on-site generation technologies, demand side management and storage systems are reshaping energy infrastructures and energy market, together with innovative business models. Optimal design and operational choices in buildings are systemic, but buildings are also nodes in infrastructural systems and model-based approaches are generally used to guide decision-making processes, at multiple scale. Built environment could represent a suitable intermediate scale of analysis in Multi-Level Perspective planning, collocated among infrastructures and users. Therefore, the spatial and temporal scalability of modelling techniques is analysed, together with the possibility of accommodating multiple stakeholders{\textquoteright} perspectives in decisionmaking, thereby finding synergies across multiple sectors of energy demand. For this reason, the paper investigates first the cross-sectorial role of models in the energy sector, because the use of common principles and techniques could stimulate a rapid development of multi-disciplinary research, aimed at sustainable energy transitions. Further, relevant issues for the integration of energy storage in built environment are described, considering their relationship with energy efficiency measures, on-site generation and demand side management.},

Customers' satisfaction should be considered in the REM procedure to motivate the customers to respond to the received price signals. This paper proposes an optimization-based REM to minimize not only the customer's energy cost but also customer dissatisfaction, which is modeled as a function of load curtailment. In addition, the impact of broad application of REM in bus 6 of RBTS is studied on the reliability of distribution system. To this end, two different methods for reliability evaluation is used to show the effect of load shift and load curtailment on the energy not supplied by the distribution system. The results verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed REM approach and show the impact of application of REM programs with different penetration levels on the reliability of distribution system.},

	abstract = {In the Smart Grid context, the involvement of end-users is a key element for the implementation of demand response, as a way to enhance the energy efficiency of the electricity infrastructure also enabling to cope with the intermittency of renewable energy sources. Although the participation of end-users may result in higher complexity of system management, it may have a positive impact on mitigating the volatility of electricity prices. End-users may also be a key component in the provision of ancillary services using demand side resources to offer the system operator additional means to enhance system flexibility, robust planning, constraint management and operation scheduling, contributing to the balance between load and supply under a load follows supply paradigm. Demand response is seen as an effective and reliable strategy for the successful integration of renewable energy sources, in a perspective of integrated energy resource management, handling the demand curve using load flexibility whenever the system requires it. This embodies the possibility of changing/controlling the load profile by optimally time deferring the use of some equipment. This paper focuses on the role of energy management systems aggregators, both concerning actual practice in industry as well as research, which can be seen as relevant players contributing to that endeavour. A review of recent literature and projects is made, putting in perspective the role of energy management systems aggregators in the Smart Grid context, in association with demand response programs and technologies, involving the participation of end-users in the provision of ancillary services. The aim is recognizing trends, opportunities, challenges and potential barriers regarding the creation of energy management systems aggregators to improve overall system performance, characterizing the services provided by aggregators and identifying potential research gaps.},

A model for demand side resources is proposed here that captures its key characteristics for commitment and dispatch calculations. The model is tested on the all island Irish power system, and the operation of the model is simulated over one year in both a stochastic and deterministic mode, to illustrate the impact of wind and load uncertainty. The results illustrate that demand side resources can contribute to the efficient, flexible operation of systems with high penetrations of wind by replacing some of the functions of conventional peaking plant. Demand side resources are also shown to be capable of improving the reliability of the system, with reserve capability identified as a key requirement in this respect.},

The literature survey focuses on recent contributions in the peer-reviewed energy economics and engineering literature. We compare key characteristics of the different models, provide an overview of model applications, and summarize key findings on power storage requirements. We also evaluate which system values of storage are covered by respective model analyses. Based on the literature survey, we identify common findings and key model features required for a sound assessment of future storage requirements. In order to raise complementary insights, we introduce DIETER, a new dispatch and investment model. The model contributes to the literature by capturing multiple system values of power storage related to arbitrage, capacity, and reserve provision. Further, the model is designed as an open-source tool that can be freely used and modified. Results of a first application of the new model are presented in a companion paper.},

We analyze the case of electric storage heaters in German 2030 scenarios with an open-source electricity sector model. We find that flexible electric heaters generally increase the use of generation technologies with low variable costs, which are not necessarily renewables. Yet making customary night-time storage heaters temporally more flexible offers only moderate benefits because renewable availability during daytime is limited in the heating season. Respective investment costs accordingly have to be very low in order to realize total system cost benefits. As storage heaters feature only short-term heat storage, they also cannot reconcile the seasonal mismatch of heat demand in winter and high renewable availability in summer. Future research should evaluate the benefits of longer-term heat storage.},

In this paper, we propose a new model to support the scheduling process for energy flexibility in buildings. We have selected an integrated energy carrier approach based on the energy hub concept, which captures multiple energy carriers, converters and storages to increase the flexibility potential. Furthermore, we propose a general classification of load units according to their flexibility properties. Finally, we define price structures that include both time-varying prices and peak power fees. We demonstrate the properties of the model in a case study based on a Norwegian university college building. The study shows that the model is able to reduce costs by reducing peak loads and utilizing price differences between periods and energy carriers. We illustrate and discuss the properties of two different approaches to deal with uncertain parameters: Rolling horizon deterministic planning and rolling horizon stochastic planning, the latter includes explicit modeling of the uncertain parameters. Although in our limited case, the stochastic model does not outperform the deterministic model, our findings indicate that several factors influence this conclusion. We recommend an in-depth analysis in each specific case.},

The objective of this paper is to analyse the role that Demand Response (DR) potentially can play in a cost-efficient development until 2050. The benefits of DR consist of integrating renewable source generation and reducing peak load consumption, leading to a reduction in generation, transmission, and storage capacity investments. The capabilities of DR are implemented in the European Model for Power Investments with high shares of Renewable Energy (EMPIRE), which is an electricity sector model for long-term capacity and transmission expansion. The model uses a multi-horizon stochastic approach including operational uncertainty with hourly resolution and multiple investment periods in the long-term. DR is modelled through several classes of shiftable and curtailable loads in residential, commercial, and industrial sectors, including flexibility periods, operational costs, losses, and endogenous DR investments, for 31 European countries. Results of the case study shows that DR capacity partially substitutes flexible supply-side capacity from peak gas plants and battery storage, through enabling more solar PV generation. A European DR capacity at 91 GW in 2050 reduces the peak plant capacities by 11\% and storage capacity by 86\%.},

	abstract = {As electricity systems integrate increasing penetrations of variable renewable energy, system operators are seeking technologies and strategies that increase their system{\textquoteright}s flexibility. Despite obstacles around hardware, market structure, and lack of experience, demand response is an important source of flexibility that complements more conventional supply-side flexibility resources. However, accurate representations of demand response in production cost models employed for grid systems analyses have been limited by incomplete formulations, inadequate real-world data, case studies with narrow applicability, and a finite list of end uses and sectors. This paper proposes a suite of demand response constraints that capture more-realistic demand response operational limitations including uptimes and downtimes, numbers of starts per day, allowable power limits, and required recovery periods. The proposed demand response implementation is tested with real-world load data for Bangalore, India. The results show that demand response reduces production costs primarily by facilitating the substitution of high-marginal-cost thermal generators with near-zero-marginal-cost renewables. Overall, demand response utilization rates are most constrained by their maximum allowable daily deployment, but intraday recovery constraints govern their operational behavior. In addition to the significant value that demand response provides to the grid, demand response aggregators can expect substantial revenues from price arbitrage.},

A microgrid is composed of distributed energy resources (DER) including renewable resources, combined heat and power generation (CHP) and conventional generation resources that rely on fossil fuels. Energy hubs in microgrids facilitate the conversion of different types of energy resources. The coupling among natural gas and electricity distribution networks introduces new challenges to the short-term operation planning of microgrids. In this paper, a two-stage stochastic optimization problem is formulated for the short-term operation planning of microgrids with multiple-energy carrier networks to determine the scheduled energy and reserve capacity. The problem is formulated as a mixed integer linear programming problem in which the objective function is to minimize the expected operation cost in the short-term operation horizon. The uncertainties in the renewable generation including the wind and solar photovoltaic generation, and electrical and thermal demands are captured by introducing scenarios with respective probabilities. The proposed solution framework ensures the reliability and security of energy supply in multiple scenarios. The advantage of capturing the interdependence among the electricity and natural gas systems to promote energy efficiency is presented. Furthermore, the effectiveness of demand response programs to reduce the operation costs and improve the security measures is investigated. The sensitivity of the operation costs to the variation of natural gas flow and congestion in pipelines and energy prices is addressed to highlight the interdependence among natural gas and electricity infrastructure systems.},

	abstract = {Demand Response (DR) is a well-known concept which has been recognized as an increasingly valuable tool to provide flexibility to the power system, to support the integration of Variable Renewable Energy (VRE) resources and to manage the grid more efficiently. In recent years, there have been a growing number of publications focusing on the estimation of different categories of DR potentials (e.g. theoretical, technical, economic, and achievable) using different methodologies and assumptions in each research study. The contribution of the present study is twofold. Firstly, a literature review is undertaken focusing specifically on the categorization of the scientific approaches used to estimate the different categories of DR potentials. To the best of authors' knowledge, a general procedure for the estimation of each DR potential category is still missing. Therefore, a novel user-friendly and step-by-step theoretical framework for the determination of the different categories of DR potentials is presented. Findings of this study reveal that literature has extensively focused on the estimation of the technical DR potential followed by the economic, theoretical and achievable potentials respectively. A lack of understanding of the different categories of DR potentials was also identified, which sometimes have been unduly used in the literature. The proposed framework is supported on a small sample of numerical approaches and equations which results in a structured approach to bringing consensus to the DR potential assessment.},

In this paper, a systematic methodology is proposed for categorizing the building energy flexibility according to different power grid requirements. Considering the requirements of response duration, response direction and response speed (within seconds, minutes, or even longer timescale), the flexibility can be categorized as fast regulation, moderate regulation, load shedding, load shifting and load covering. A comprehensive review is presented to summarize and compare various flexibility sources, their characteristics and capabilities in buildings for providing those five different types of energy flexibility. The analysis of available information technologies and business development indicate great capability and potential of buildings to participate in energy flexibility markets as a practical demand side management instrument.

The development of industry and the increasing of the energy demand in the today{\textquoteright}s power system make it possible to maximize the potential of existing and renewable energy resources. On the other hand, using of these resources required efficient management and planning model, because without the adequate energy management, the power system cannot reach a high-performance model with maximum efficiency. Therefore, this paper first addresses the modeling of energy management in smart buildings having responsive/non-responsive devices and renewable photovoltaic resources. To manage the solar system employment, the KNX protocol is used. Also, the batteries are used in a way that they are charged at low power consumption and it will be as a generating unit during the peak-load time, therefore, the objective function is minimizing the power system loss and the related cost. Since the proposed model is nonlinear and has some complexity, the particle swarm algorithm (PSO) is used. To achieve the minimum losses, the best candidate buses are selected based on the proposed sensitivity analysis to manage the connected buildings. As a result, the function of the overall cost is based on the amount of energy produced and sold. Finally, the presented model is examined and evaluated on modified IEEE 30-bus test system based on the statistical analysis in different scenarios. Moreover, it is conclude from the planning that the operating cost significantly controls by the charge and discharge mechanism of the battery and the photovoltaic units.},

First, a comprehensive review of recent literature and projects is presented, with particular attention on RAs{\textquoteright} roles in electricity markets as well as their difference from other market entities. Then, the business model for RA is analyzed systematically, involving resource aggregation, basic information prediction, market bidding strategy development, and settlement process. Besides, information about existing RAs around the world is collected and compared to understand the development status and existing challenges.},

	abstract = {Demand Response (DR) is known as an effective solution for many power grid problems such as high operating cost as well as high peak demand. In order to achieve full potential of DR programs, DR must be implemented optimally. On this basis, determining optimal DR location, appropriate DR program and efficient penetration rate for each DR program is of great practical interest due to the fact that it guides the system operators to choose proper DR strategies. This paper presents a novel linear framework for DR optimization problem incorporated into the network-constrained unit commitment with the aim of determining optimal location, type and penetration rate of DR programs considering several practical limitations. To this end, a number of tariff-based and incentive-based DR programs have been taken into account according to the customer{\textquoteright}s benefit function based on the price elasticity concept. The IEEE 24-bus Reliability Test System (RTS 24-bus) is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed model. Finally, DR optimization is analyzed with regards to different customer{\textquoteright}s elasticity values and also different number of candidate load buses which reveal the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

The introduced tool considers electric and hydrogen vehicles and provides optimal charging pattern for them. The water electrolyze is also modeled to produced breathable oxygen and hydrogen from water. As well, the load modeling options such as adjustable and interruptible loads are included in the planning in order to increase the flexibility and adeptness of the proposed energy management system. The uncertainties of wind and solar powers are included resulting in a stochastic programming. The proposed stochastic optimization problem is mathematically expressed as a mixed integer linear programming and solved by GAMS software. The problem minimizes cost of energy consumption in the building subject to the operational constraints of wind unit, solar panel, battery system, loads, electric-hydrogen vehicles, and electricity grid. The proposed test building is studied under two states including connected to the electrical grid and disconnected from the gird (i.e., islanding mode or NetZero energy home). The impacts of the proposed planning on the environmental pollution are also considered and simulated. The results verify that the proposed strategy can successfully utilize wind-solar-battery units to supply the load, charging the electric-hydrogen vehicles, and reduction of the pollution. As well, it is demonstrated that the operation of the home under islanding mode is completely different from the connected state.},

	abstract = {This paper presents a two-stage operation optimization method of an integrated energy system (IES) with demand response (DR) and energy storage. The proposed method divides the optimal scheduling problem of the IES into two optimization problems, including demand-side and supply-side optimization problems. An interactive mechanism between the customer demand and operation scheme is established. In the first stage, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used to optimize electricity, cooling, and heating demand curves within the comfort requirements of customers. In the second stage, stochastic dynamic programming (SDP) is applied to determine the optimal energy production and storage scheme based on the demand curves generated by GA. The results of the second stage are then fed back to GA to re-optimize the demand curves. The optimization process loops until the optimal demand curves and operation scheme are obtained. The proposed method gives full play to the advantages of GA and SDP, so as to increase the possibility of finding the global optimal solution. Case studies are performed on a hotel in northern China to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method. Simulation results show that the proposed method obtains an efficient and cost-effective operation strategy and reduces the operation cost by 3.6\% in comparison with the traditional GA method. The proposed method will help decision-makers determine operation schemes of IESs and can also help consumers to gain more profits.},

	abstract = {The power system is undergoing a significant change as it adapts to the intermittency and uncertainty from renewable generation. Flexibility from loads such as electric vehicles (EVs) can serve as reserves to sustain the supply-demand balance in the grid. Some reserve markets have rules for participation that are computationally challenging for aggregators of such flexible loads: they are asked to bid both volume and price, and on top of this there is a minimum-volume requirement, a constraint currently under discussion both in the US and European markets. Several state-of-the-art methods to find a bidding strategy for the demand scheduling of large fleets of flexible loads in the day-ahead and reserve market are adapted to deal with such a shared constraint, and are compared based on costs, unscheduled demand, and running time. The experimental analysis shows that although such a shared constraint significantly affects scalability, some of the proposed adaptations can deal with this without much loss in quality. This comparison also shows the importance of including good uncertainty models for dealing with the risk of not meeting the users{\textquoteright} demands, and that it is possible to find an optimal single price per time unit for scheduling a fleet of EVs.},

Various attempts can be found in the literature concerning thermal demand modification in district heating, despite often researchers working on this topic are not fully aware of the other research activities also because various names are used to identify similar techniques. This paper represents the first survey on the use demand side application in district heating networks. The review clarifies the terminology and the stages for implementing demand side management to district heating network. Simulations and real applications are both considered in the review, including direct and indirect demand side management (demand response). Demand side management is found to be a great technique for district heating management. Various works show that the following benefits can be achieved: peak shaving up to 30\%, doubled load factor, reduction of primary energy needs up to 5\%, emission and cost reduction up to 10\%. This clearly leads to significant cost and emission reduction, contributing to the decarbonization of urban areas.},

Over the past years, capacity remuneration mechanisms have been introduced in more European Member States and have evolved from temporal to permanent solutions to ensure resource adequacy. In this study, we analyze the effects of introducing a strategic reserve, a capacity market, and capacity subscription as well as their interactions with different CO2 limits on eligible technologies during a transition of a power system based in the Netherlands. We apply a co-simulation of two agent-based models. We find that a strategic reserve is the most effective method for reducing shortages during the energy transition, but at the cost of high and volatile wholesale prices. As an alternative, capacity subscription can incentivize demand-side response from all consumers; however, it requires guidance to prevent investment cycles. Furthermore, we discuss the importance of carefully implementing CO2 limitations in CRMs to ensure their effectiveness.}

	abstract = {Demand response (DR) is expected to play a major role in integrating large shares of variable renewable energy (VRE) sources in power systems. For example, DR can increase or decrease consumption depending on the VRE availability, and use generating and network assets more efficiently. Detailed DR models are usually very complex, hence, unsuitable for large-scale energy models, where simplicity and linearity are key elements to keep a reasonable computational performance. In contrast, aggregated DR models are usually too simplistic and therefore conclusions derived from them may be misleading. This paper focuses on classifying and modelling DR in large-scale models. The first part of the paper classifies different DR services, and provides an overview of benefits and challenges. The second part presents mathematical formulations for different types of DR ranging from curtailment and ideal shifting, to shifting including saturation and immediate load recovery. Here, we suggest a collection of linear constraints that are appropriate for large-scale power systems and integrated energy system models, but sufficiently sophisticated to capture the key effects of DR in the energy system. We also propose a mixed-integer programming formulation for load shifting that guarantees immediate load recovery, and its linear relaxation better approximates the exact solution compared with previous models.},

However, the standard Mixed-Integer Programming (MIP) models that describe optimal investment and operation of these storage units, including the optional capacity to provide up/down reserves, do not scale well. To improve scalability, the integrality constraints are often relaxed, resulting in Linear Programming (LP) relaxations that allow simultaneous charging and discharging, while this is not feasible in practice. To address this, we derive the convex hull of the solutions for the optimal operation of storage for one time period, as well as for problems including investments and reserves, guaranteeing that no tighter MIP formulation or better LP approximation exists for one time period. When included in multi-period large-scale energy system models, these improved LP relaxations can better prevent simultaneous charging and discharging. We demonstrate this with illustrative case studies of a unit commitment problem and a transmission expansion planning problem.},

Thanks to its technology richness across all main sectors—including power production, transport, industry and the commercial, agricultural and residential sectors—it allows for performing in-depth studies on the role of a large range of low-carbon options in the energy transition of all European countries, both jointly and individually. Three characteristics render TIMES-Europe particularly valuable: (1) it covers the entire European energy system and its main greenhouse gas emissions, (2) it includes all EU member states individually as well as a large set of countries in the EU’s vicinity, and (3) it can be used to generate high-level strategic insights as well as detailed recommendations for both national and EU policies. TIMES-Europe is especially suitable for analyzing system integration, which makes it an ideal tool for assessing the implementation of the energy transition and the establishment of a low-carbon economy. We present several research and scenario examples, and characterize opportunities for future energy and climate policy analysis.},
