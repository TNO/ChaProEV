These scenario files contain the following sections: - unit_conversions: Parameters to convert units - files: File-related parameters (folders, output type choices, etc.) - colors: Color-related parameters(defining new ones, as well as color bars) - time: Time-related parameters and constants needed in formulas - run: Parameters related to the run, such as timing, and elements such as locations, vehicles, legs, trips, etc. - weather: Parameters related to the weather, such as elements to define what we want to download from various sources, where we store weather data, how we process it, or how we want to label quantititis - plots: Parameters for plots (colors, sizes, etc.) define.py: This module defines and declares classes for the different objects that define the system (the parameters/defintions come from a parameters file), namely: 1. Legs: Legs are point-to-point vehicle movements (i.e. movements where the vehicle goes from a start location and ends/stops at an end location). 2. Vehicles: Each vehicle type (or subtype) is defined in this class. weather.py This module contains functions related to weather data and factors. The weather data is pulled from the CDS (Climate Data Store) ERA-5 weather data from the Copernicus institute . This data contains many quantities (such as temperature, precipitation, or solar radiation) at an hourly level (starting in 1950) for the whole world, at a one-decimal resolution for latitudes and longitudes. Note that the data sometimes has trailing digits, but the resolution still seems to be to the first decimal. This is the reason why we round the coordinate values in our processing functions.

Legs are point-to-point vehicle movements (i.e. movements where the vehicle goes from a start location and ends/stops at an end location). Parameters The parameters of a leg are: Name: The name of the leg Distance: The distance driven during the leg (in kilometers) Duration: How long it takes to drive the leg (in hours) Hour in day factors: These factors add a correction to the vehicle consumption that depend on the hour in day (the first is for 00:00 to 00:59, last for 23:00 to 23:59). Note that these are actual hours, not hours in the user day (which can start and end at other moments than midnight). This is used to take into account things like traffic jams. The default value is 1. This factor is a placeholder and is currently not in use. Location This class defines the locations where the vehicles are and their properties, from a scenario file that contains a list of instances and their proper. Parameters The parameters of a location are: Name : The name of the location. Vehicle: The vehicle that uses the location. If this does not correspond to the scenario vehicle name , then the trip is not declared. Note that when running a scenario, you select one vehicle, so this is in principle not necessary. The reason for having this is to allow the user to copy the baseline file and keep the location definitions that are not used for this scenario but might be so for another, thereby reducing the need for changes between scenarios. Connectivity: A value between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%) that tells the probability that a vehicle parked at this location is connected to a charger. Charging power: The (peak) charging power of the charger at this location (in kW). Charger efficiency: A value between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%) that tells how much of the power drawn from the network is delivered to the battery of the vehicle. Latitude: The latitude of the location. This factor is a placeholder and is currently not in use. Longitude: The longitude of the location. This factor is a placeholder and is currently not in use. Base charging price: The base/reference (i.e. before flexibility/temporal changes) charging price at this location, in \u20ac/kWh. This factor is a placeholder and is currently not in use. Charging desirability: A value between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%) that tells how much the users like to charge at this location. This factor is a placeholder and is currently not in use. Percentage in location at run start: A value between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%) that tells which percentage of the vehicles start the run there. This is used if we will that in directly instead of computing it. The decision t use this is controlled by the compute_start_location_split parameter in the mobility module. Trip This class defines the trips and their properties, from a scenario file that contains a list of instances and their properties. Trips are collections of legs that take place on a given day. Note that this day does not necessarily start (and end) at midnight, but can start (and end) at an hour that is more logical/significant for the vehicle user (it could for example be 05:00 for car drivers). This day start hour parameter is universal for all trips This value is set in the scenario files. Parameters Name : The name of the trip. Vehicle: The vehicle that does the trip. If this does not correspond to the scenario vehicle name , then the trip is not declared. Note that when running a scenario, you select one vehicle, so this is in principle not necessary. The reason for having this is to allow the user to copy the baseline file and keep the trip definitions that are not used for this scenario but might be so for another, thereby reducing the need for changes between scenarios. Legs: A list of the legs in the trip. Time between legs: A list of the time spent at the arrival locations between each leg (in hours). Percentage station users: A value between 0 and 1 (0% to 100%) that tells us which percentage of users use fast charging stations. This factor is a placeholder and is currently not in use. Start probabilities: A list of values between 0 and 1 (0%-100%) adding up to 1/100% that tells us what the probability of starting the trip is at a given hour. Note that the hours start at day start hour , not at midnight. Leg repetitions: A list for repetitions for each leg (set at zero if the leg is not repeated), of the same length as the amount of legs. Note that if two (or more) consecutive legs have repetitions, then they are the sequences of legs is repeated. For more detail, see here . Time between repetitions: A list of times (in hours) between two repetitions of a leg. Note that the index/position in the list starts at the day start hour , not at midnight. This allows for things like more frequent repeats of legs at peak hours, for example. Mobility matrix The main aim of the trip initialization/declaration is to create a mobility matrix for the trip. This mobility matrix has, for all combinations of possible start and end locations (i.e. locations connected by a leg in the trip) and for each hour in day number (starting at the day start hour ), the following quantities: 1. Duration: The duration (in hours) of a leg between the start location and the end location. 2. Distance: The distance (in kilometers) of a leg between the start location. 3. Weighted distance: The weighted distance (in kilometers) of a leg between the start location and the end location. This corresponds to using different road types , with given weights and given mixes to account for the fact that vehicles consume more on some road types. 4. Departures amount : The chance that a vehicle, in a given hour, leaves the start location, going to the end location (amount and chance are equivalent here, as we compute on an individual vehicle basis). 5. Departures kilometers: The kilometers driven by vehicles leaving the start location at a given hour and going to the end location. This is given by the departures amount times the distance. 6. Departures weighted kilometers: The weighted (by road type) kilometers driven by vehicles leaving the start location at a given hour and going to the end location. This is given by the departures amount times the weighted distance. 7.

This is given by the arrivals amount times the weighted distance. Leg repetitions Is repeat of leg or two legs???? [0, 5, 5, 0] If next leg is also repeated/still has repeats left, then it is repeated after the leg in question so when putting a leg, check if it is repeated.
